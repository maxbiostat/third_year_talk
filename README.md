# Third year talk
My talk at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology Postgraduate Symposium 2017

This talk is about the [transition kernels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_kernel) we developed for [BEAST](http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/). I spend most of the talk motivating Bayesian phylogenetics and providing some background. At the end I move on to show some results on small data sets.
