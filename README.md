# Third year talk
My talk at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology Postgraduate Symposium 2017

This talk is about the [transition kernels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_kernel) we developed for [BEAST](http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/). I spend most of the talk motivating Bayesian phylogenetics and providing some background. At the end I move on to show some results on small data sets.

Here's a nice animation of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm I found online:

If this is up your alley, you might want to take a look at some of the [animations](https://github.com/maxbiostat/third_year_talk/blob/master/animations/sampling_trees.md) I've put together to illustrate MCMC on trees. 

For this talk I have stolen figures and/or slides from:
- [Erick Matsen](https://github.com/matsen) and [Chris Whidden](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~whidden/); 
- [Paul Lewis](http://phylogeny.uconn.edu/person/paul-lewis/);
- [Mark Holder](http://phylo.bio.ku.edu/content/mark-t-holder);
- [Sebastian Hoehna](https://github.com/hoehna);
- [This paper](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002947);
